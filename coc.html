Students can add or generate their certificates and store them on the portal which is accessed by universities and companies. Companies can request the university for a particular studentâ€™s details, and if the university approves the request then details will be shared with companies for further process. Students can block or unblock the companies by using the portal. If the university wants to block any student then they can do it. The role of the admin is to approve/block the companies and universities.</p>
