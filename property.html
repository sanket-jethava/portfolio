                    <p class="mb-30">Property details scraper is the automation and scraping project in which we had
                        automated the n number of property websites, as the code was written to open the
                        property-related websites using the automated multiple chrome browsers as multi-threading was
                        used to open more than one browser instance at a time, and once the links were opened, we have
                        added the functionality to scrape all those listed property details using the beautiful Soup and
                        saving all of them in the database in an organized way.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">And on successful completion or any cause of the error, the admin was notified
                        directly through the slack, which we integrated into the code. </p>

                    <p class="mb-30">Along with that, we had also created the API endpoints, from where users can
                        retrieve and filter out the property details directly from the server.</p>
